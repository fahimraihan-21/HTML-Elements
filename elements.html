computers that were on the market, those computers were impractical for us to use. We needed a Volkswagen. The
Volkswagen isn't as fast or comfortable as other ways of traveling, but the VW owners can go where they want, when they
want and with whom they want. The VW owners have personal control of their car.</q>
